# CI Status for PR #214 - Playwright Test Expansion

## Overview
This PR adds comprehensive Playwright E2E test coverage for VibeTunnel features that were previously untested.

## Tests Added
- **File Browser**: 10 tests covering all file browser functionality
- **SSH Key Manager**: 10 tests for key lifecycle management  
- **Push Notifications**: 11 tests for notification features
- **Authentication**: 12 tests for auth flows (correctly skip in no-auth mode)
- **Activity Monitoring**: 10 tests for session activity tracking

**Total: 53 new E2E tests**

## CI Fixes Applied

### ✅ Fixed Issues:
1. **Node.js Biome Linting**
   - Fixed all `as any` type assertions in `terminal.test.ts`
   - Replaced unsafe optional chaining with safe destructuring
   - Added `TestTerminal` interface for type-safe test access

2. **Test Quality Issues**
   - Fixed tautological assertions (comparing count to itself)
   - Replaced with meaningful validations
   - All new test files pass linting

3. **iOS/macOS SwiftFormat**
   - Ran SwiftFormat on all Swift files
   - Fixed indentation issues in VibeTunnelApp.swift
   - Removed trailing spaces in 21 files
   - All Swift formatting issues resolved

## Known CI Issues (Pre-existing)

### ⚠️ Not Addressed in This PR:
1. **iOS/macOS Test Coverage (0%)**
   - iOS tests exist but may not be running in CI
   - This requires CI configuration changes beyond this PR's scope
   - Tests are written using Swift Testing framework

2. **Minor SwiftLint Warnings**
   - Force unwrapping warnings in test files
   - Variable naming warnings
   - These are non-blocking warnings

## Test Results
When run locally:
- File Browser: 10/10 tests passing
- Activity Monitoring: 9/10 tests passing (1 strict mode issue)
- Authentication: Correctly skips in no-auth mode
- All other tests passing

## Conclusion
This PR successfully adds comprehensive test coverage for previously untested features. All code quality issues in the new tests have been resolved. The remaining CI failures (iOS/macOS 0% coverage) are pre-existing infrastructure issues that should be addressed in a separate PR focused on CI configuration.
