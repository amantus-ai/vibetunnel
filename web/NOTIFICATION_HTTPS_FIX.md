# VibeTunnel Push Notification HTTPS Fix

## Issue Summary

Push notifications were not working when accessing VibeTunnel via HTTP (non-secure context). The notification toggle appeared disabled with a warning message, preventing users from enabling notifications even on localhost.

## Root Cause

The push notification service requires a secure context (`window.isSecureContext`) to function properly because:
1. Service Workers only work in secure contexts (HTTPS or localhost)
2. Push API requires HTTPS for security reasons
3. The initialization was returning early when not in a secure context

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Security Check Logging
Added explicit security context check with helpful logging in `push-notification-service.ts`:
```typescript
// Check if we're in a secure context (HTTPS or localhost)
// Service workers require HTTPS except for localhost/127.0.0.1
if (!window.isSecureContext) {
  logger.warn(
    'Push notifications require HTTPS or localhost. Current context is not secure.'
  );
  return;
}
```

### 2. Improved Initialization Logging
Added detailed logging in `app.ts` to help debug initialization issues:
```typescript
logger.log('Push notification initialization complete:', {
  isSupported,
  isSecureContext: isSecure,
  location: window.location.hostname,
  protocol: window.location.protocol,
});
```

### 3. Enhanced User Guidance
Updated the warning message in `settings.ts` to be more helpful:
- Shows the current URL being used
- Provides specific alternatives that will work:
  - HTTPS version of current URL
  - localhost:4020
  - 127.0.0.1:4020

## How to Enable Notifications

To use push notifications, access VibeTunnel via:

1. **HTTPS**: `https://your-hostname:port`
2. **Localhost**: `http://localhost:4020`
3. **Local IP**: `http://127.0.0.1:4020`

## Technical Details

### Service Worker Requirements
- Service Workers require HTTPS except for localhost/127.0.0.1
- This is a browser security restriction, not a VibeTunnel limitation
- The check uses `window.isSecureContext` which is true for:
  - HTTPS origins
  - localhost (any port)
  - 127.0.0.1 (any port)
  - file:// URLs (but not relevant for web apps)

### Push API Requirements
- Push subscriptions require VAPID keys
- VAPID keys are fetched from the server during initialization
- The subscription process requires user permission

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Access VibeTunnel via localhost:4020
2. Open browser console and check for initialization logs
3. Go to Settings â†’ Notifications
4. The toggle should be enabled (not grayed out)
5. Toggle notifications on
6. Test with the "Test Notification" button

## Debug Commands

If notifications still don't work, run these in the browser console:

```javascript
// Check if in secure context
console.log('Secure context:', window.isSecureContext);

// Check service worker registration
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(regs => console.log('Service Workers:', regs));

// Check notification permission
console.log('Permission:', Notification.permission);

// Force re-initialization
window.pushNotificationService?.initialize();
```
