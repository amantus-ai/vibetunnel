# VibeTunnel Node.js OOM Crash Analysis

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-24

## Quick Recovery Guide (If You're Here After a Crash)

If you're reading this after experiencing OOM crashes:

1. **Check Current Status**:
   ```bash
   # Check which tests are disabled
   ls -la src/test/integration/*.disabled
   
   # Check if memory fixes are applied
   grep -l "SessionTestHelper" src/test/integration/*.test.ts
   ```

2. **Isolate Problematic Test**:
   ```bash
   # Run tests one by one with increased memory
   NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192" pnpm test -- src/test/integration/[specific-test].test.ts
   ```

3. **Resume Point**: Jump to [Test Execution Plan](#test-execution-plan) section

## Issue Summary
VibeTunnel experiences catastrophic Out of Memory (OOM) crashes during test runs that kill ALL VibeTunnel instances simultaneously. This happens because all VT instances share a single server process on port 4020.

## Symptoms

### User-Visible Impact
- All VibeTunnel windows/sessions terminate simultaneously
- Tests may hang/timeout or crash with OOM
- Node process is killed by macOS kernel OOM killer
- Multiple crash reports generated in `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/`

### Technical Symptoms
```
stderr | src/test/integration/worktree-workflows-refactored.test.ts
2025-07-23T09:10:42.100Z ERROR [[SRV] pty-manager] Failed to handle exit for session f3603149-8a59-44a8-b0d8-970794a686d4: {
  "code": "SESSION_NOT_FOUND",
  "name": "PtyError"
}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Architecture Issue
VibeTunnel uses a shared server architecture:
```
ServerManager.swift:33: "http://localhost:4020"
```
- ONE vt server process serves ALL VibeTunnel instances
- Test processes run as children of this server
- Memory exhaustion in tests crashes the parent server
- This terminates ALL connected VT sessions

### Test Investigation Results

#### E2E Test Investigation (from crashtest.md)
Systematic testing of individual e2e tests revealed:
- **No e2e tests cause actual Node.js crashes**
- `terminal-interaction.spec.ts` - **HANGS/TIMES OUT** after 2 minutes but does NOT crash
- 13 e2e tests were tested individually, all completed without crashing:
  - minimal-session.spec.ts ✅
  - test-session-persistence.spec.ts ✅
  - activity-monitoring.spec.ts ✅
  - session-navigation.spec.ts ✅
  - authentication.spec.ts ✅
  - debug-session.spec.ts ✅
  - file-browser.spec.ts ✅
  - basic-session.spec.ts ✅
  - file-browser-basic.spec.ts ✅
  - push-notifications.spec.ts ✅
  - session-creation.spec.ts ✅
  - session-management.spec.ts ✅
  - terminal-interaction.spec.ts ⏱️ (hangs, no crash)

#### Integration Test Investigation
The actual OOM crash is likely in integration tests, specifically:
- `worktree-workflows-refactored.test.ts` - Primary suspect based on error logs

### Crash Report Analysis
From system crash reports (e.g., `node-2025-07-23-101351.ips`):

1. **Signal**: SIGABRT (abort() called)
2. **Root Cause**: Out of Memory - V8 heap allocation failure
3. **Stack Trace Pattern**:
   ```
   node::OOMErrorHandler
   v8::internal::V8::FatalProcessOutOfMemory
   v8::internal::Heap::FatalProcessOutOfMemory
   ```

4. **Memory Allocation Context**:
   - `KeyAccumulator::AddKey` - Building large collections
   - `OrderedHashSet::Add` - Set operations with many elements
   - `ObjectGetOwnPropertyNames` - Enumerating object properties
   - `PrepareStackTraceCallback` - Generating stack traces

### Likely Culprits

#### 1. Integration Tests (worktree-workflows-refactored.test.ts)
- Creates multiple TestServer instances with heavy services
- Sessions not properly cleaned up (SESSION_NOT_FOUND errors)
- Each PTY allocates significant memory for buffers
- Services hold references preventing garbage collection

#### 2. E2E Tests (terminal-interaction.spec.ts)
- Heavy terminal interaction and output capture
- May accumulate large amounts of terminal data
- Playwright page state/DOM inspection
- Causes hangs/timeouts but not confirmed crashes

### Memory Explosion Pattern
The crashes show a pattern of:
1. Tests creating many objects/sessions
2. V8 trying to enumerate properties (ObjectGetOwnPropertyNames)
3. Building large hash sets (OrderedHashSet operations)
4. Stack trace generation adding more memory pressure
5. Garbage collection fails to free enough memory
6. V8 aborts with OOM

## The Fix

### Immediate Solutions

1. **For Integration Tests**:
```typescript
afterEach(async () => {
  // Kill all sessions created in this test
  const sessions = await testServer.sessionManager.getAllSessions();
  for (const session of sessions) {
    await testServer.sessionManager.killSession(session.id);
  }
  
  // Clear any accumulated buffers
  testServer.streamWatcher.clearAll();
  
  // Force garbage collection if possible
  if (global.gc) {
    global.gc();
  }
});

afterAll(async () => {
  // Ensure complete cleanup
  await testServer.stop();
  testServer = null;
});
```

2. **For E2E Tests**:
- Limit terminal output capture
- Clear page state between tests
- Add explicit cleanup of Playwright resources
- Set reasonable timeouts

3. **Run Tests with More Memory**:
```bash
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192" pnpm test
```

### Long-term Fixes

1. **Resource Limits**
   - Implement per-session memory limits
   - Add buffer size caps for PTY output
   - Monitor and limit total session count

2. **Better Cleanup**
   - Ensure PTY processes are killed
   - Clear all service references
   - Implement timeout-based cleanup
   - Add explicit garbage collection hints

3. **Test Isolation**
   - Run heavy tests in separate processes
   - Use worker threads for isolation
   - Implement test timeouts
   - Split large test files

4. **Architecture Improvements**
   - Consider process isolation per session
   - Implement crash boundaries
   - Add memory monitoring
   - Use separate ports for test servers

## Prevention

1. **Testing Guidelines**
   - Always clean up sessions in afterEach
   - Limit concurrent session creation
   - Use smaller test datasets
   - Monitor memory usage in CI
   - Set explicit test timeouts

2. **Code Review Checklist**
   - Check for proper resource cleanup
   - Verify session termination
   - Look for reference accumulation
   - Test with memory constraints
   - Review object enumeration operations

3. **Monitoring**
   - Add memory usage logging
   - Track session lifecycle
   - Alert on resource leaks
   - Monitor test duration
   - Capture heap snapshots in CI

## Status
- **CONFIRMED**: E2E tests do NOT cause the OOM crash (13 tests verified)
- E2E test `terminal-interaction.spec.ts` causes hangs/timeouts only
- Integration test `worktree-workflows-refactored.test.ts` was initially suspected
- **UPDATE 2025-01-24**: Even after disabling `worktree-workflows-refactored.test.ts`, OOM crashes continue!
- This means there are OTHER integration tests also causing memory issues
- Multiple crash reports confirm OOM in V8 heap during object operations

## Active Integration Tests (Potential OOM Sources)
After disabling `worktree-workflows-refactored.test.ts`, these integration tests remain active:
1. `src/test/integration/bonjour-discovery.test.ts`
2. `src/test/integration/file-upload.test.ts`
3. `src/test/integration/socket-protocol-integration.test.ts`
4. `src/test/integration/vt-command.test.ts`
5. `src/test/integration/worktree-workflows.test.ts` (different from the disabled one!)

**CRITICAL**: DO NOT run all tests together without explicit permission - this WILL crash all VibeTunnel instances!

## Stack Trace Analysis from Crash Log

From the crash log `node-2025-07-23-101351.ips`, the crash occurs in vitest process with this stack:
1. **Signal**: SIGABRT (abort() called) 
2. **Thread Name**: "node (vitest 1)" - confirms this is during test execution
3. **Key Stack Frames**:
   - `node::OOMErrorHandler` → `v8::internal::V8::FatalProcessOutOfMemory`
   - `v8::internal::Heap::FatalProcessOutOfMemory` → Heap allocation failure
   - `node::PrepareStackTraceCallback` → Stack trace generation adding memory pressure
   - Called from timer context: `node::Environment::RunTimers`

This indicates tests are creating memory pressure through:
- Heavy timer usage
- Stack trace generation (possibly from error handling)
- Multiple V8Worker threads running concurrent sweeps

## Investigation Strategy (WITHOUT running tests)

1. **Static Analysis of Test Files**:
   - Check each integration test for memory-heavy patterns:
     - Multiple TestServer instances
     - Large data operations
     - Missing cleanup in afterEach/afterAll
     - Timer-heavy operations
   
2. **Individual Test Execution** (with user permission):
   - Run tests ONE AT A TIME with memory monitoring:
     ```bash
     NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192" pnpm test -- src/test/integration/[specific-test].test.ts
     ```
   
3. **Memory Profiling** (if needed):
   - Use heap snapshots to identify memory leaks
   - Monitor process memory during individual test runs

## FOUND: Critical Memory Issues in worktree-workflows.test.ts

**THIS IS LIKELY THE CULPRIT!** Analysis reveals severe memory management issues:

1. **No Service Cleanup in afterAll**:
   - Creates `sessionManager`, `terminalManager`, `activityMonitor`, `streamWatcher`, `localPtyManager`
   - NEVER disposes of these services after tests complete
   - Services continue to hold references and consume memory

2. **Incomplete Session Cleanup**:
   - `beforeEach` only calls `localPtyManager.closeSession()` 
   - Does NOT clear sessions from `sessionManager`
   - Sessions accumulate across test runs

3. **Multiple Test Repositories**:
   - Creates test repos in `beforeAll` and another in nested `describe` block
   - File system operations without proper cleanup between tests

4. **Concurrent Operations Without Limits**:
   - Test sends 5 concurrent git events without any throttling
   - Each event updates all sessions, creating memory pressure

5. **Express App Not Cleaned Up**:
   - Creates Express app with routes but never closes/disposes it
   - Routes hold references to all services

### Fixed Memory Issues

#### 1. **worktree-workflows.test.ts** - FIXED ✅
- Added proper session cleanup in `afterAll` and `beforeEach`
- Now kills all sessions using `localPtyManager.killSession()`
- Calls `sessionManager.cleanupExitedSessions()` to remove from storage
- Fixed individual test cleanup to use async killSession

#### 2. **socket-protocol-integration.test.ts** - FIXED ✅
- Added session tracking array to monitor all created sessions
- Created `createTrackedSession` helper function
- Removed redundant individual `killSession` calls
- Added comprehensive cleanup in `afterEach` hook

#### 3. **Other Integration Tests Status**:
- **file-upload.test.ts** - ✅ Already has proper cleanup
- **bonjour-discovery.test.ts** - ✅ Skipped & has cleanup
- **vt-command.test.ts** - ✅ Skipped & no PTY usage
- **pty-title-integration.test.ts** - ✅ Excellent cleanup pattern

## Resolution Summary

The OOM crashes were caused by:
1. **worktree-workflows.test.ts** - Missing service cleanup, incomplete session disposal
2. **socket-protocol-integration.test.ts** - No session tracking, potential leaks on test failures

Both files have been fixed with proper cleanup patterns. The integration tests should now run without causing OOM crashes.

### Test Execution Results (2025-01-24)

**SUCCESS: No OOM crashes occurred during test execution!** 🎉

The memory leak fixes using SessionTestHelper were successful:
- **socket-protocol-integration.test.ts**: All 10 tests passed without memory issues
- **worktree-workflows.test.ts**: Had 7 test failures BUT no OOM crash (failures are due to API/routing issues, not memory)
- **pty-title-integration.test.ts**: All 7 tests passed, excellent cleanup pattern
- Other tests were skipped but wouldn't have caused crashes anyway

The key fix was ensuring tests only kill sessions they create, preventing interference with other VibeTunnel instances and avoiding memory accumulation from orphaned PTY sessions.

### Safety Measures Implemented

**CRITICAL**: Tests now only kill sessions they create!
- Both test files track their created sessions (using Set/Array)
- Never use `sessionManager.listSessions()` to kill all sessions
- This prevents killing sessions from other VibeTunnel instances
- Added warning comments to both test files about this safety requirement

## Complete Fix Summary

### 1. Created SessionTestHelper (`src/test/helpers/session-test-helper.ts`)
- Centralized session tracking for tests
- Methods: `trackSession()`, `createTrackedSession()`, `killTrackedSessions()`
- Ensures tests only clean up sessions they create
- Prevents interference with other VibeTunnel instances

### 2. Fixed Test Files
- **worktree-workflows.test.ts**: 
  - Added session tracking with `SessionTestHelper`
  - Removed dangerous `sessionManager.listSessions()` calls
  - Fixed cleanup in all `afterAll`/`beforeEach` hooks
  - Tracks sessions created via API calls

- **socket-protocol-integration.test.ts**:
  - Replaced manual array tracking with `SessionTestHelper`
  - Removed redundant individual `killSession` calls
  - Consolidated cleanup in `afterEach` hook

### 3. Code Quality Improvements
- Removed all redundant "cleanup handled by" comments
- Fixed recursive function bug in socket tests
- Applied consistent cleanup patterns across all tests

## Test Execution Plan

### Pre-Test Checklist
- [ ] All VibeTunnel instances closed (check Activity Monitor)
- [ ] No node processes on port 4020: `lsof -i :4020`
- [ ] Clean test environment: `cd web && pnpm run clean`
- [ ] Verify fixes applied: `grep -l "SessionTestHelper" src/test/integration/*.test.ts`

### Systematic Test Execution

**IMPORTANT**: Document each step. If crash occurs, note which test caused it.

#### Phase 1: Individual Integration Tests
Run each test separately with memory monitoring:

```bash
# Set increased memory limit
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"

# Test 1: Socket Protocol (FIXED)
echo "Testing: socket-protocol-integration.test.ts"
pnpm test -- src/test/integration/socket-protocol-integration.test.ts

# Test 2: Worktree Workflows (FIXED)
echo "Testing: worktree-workflows.test.ts"
pnpm test -- src/test/integration/worktree-workflows.test.ts

# Test 3: File Upload (Already had good cleanup)
echo "Testing: file-upload.test.ts"
pnpm test -- src/test/integration/file-upload.test.ts

# Test 4: VT Command (Skipped, no PTY usage)
echo "Testing: vt-command.test.ts"
pnpm test -- src/test/integration/vt-command.test.ts

# Test 5: Bonjour Discovery (Skipped, has cleanup)
echo "Testing: bonjour-discovery.test.ts"
pnpm test -- src/test/integration/bonjour-discovery.test.ts
```

#### Phase 2: Combined Tests
Only if all individual tests pass:

```bash
# Run all integration tests together
echo "Testing: All integration tests"
pnpm test -- src/test/integration

# If successful, run all tests
echo "Testing: Full test suite"
pnpm test
```

### Crash Recovery Protocol

If a crash occurs:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   ```bash
   # Kill any remaining node processes
   pkill -9 node
   
   # Check which test was running
   echo "Last test attempted: [DOCUMENT HERE]"
   ```

2. **Isolate the Problem**:
   - Disable the problematic test: `mv [test].test.ts [test].test.ts.disabled`
   - Document in this file under "Newly Discovered Issues"
   - Continue with remaining tests

3. **Analysis Steps**:
   - Check for memory leaks in the specific test
   - Look for missing cleanup
   - Check for large data operations
   - Review timer usage

- No OOM crashes
- No interference with other VibeTunnel instances
- Test execution time: ~4.5 seconds

The test file is now safe to run and properly manages its resources without leaving garbage or consuming excessive memory.

### Future Improvements

1. **Memory Monitoring**:
   ```javascript
   beforeEach(() => {
     console.log('Memory:', process.memoryUsage().heapUsed / 1024 / 1024, 'MB');
   });
   ```

2. **Test Timeout Limits**:
   ```javascript
   it('test name', async () => {
     // test code
   }, 30000); // 30 second timeout
   ```

3. **Resource Limits**:
   - Implement maximum session count per test
