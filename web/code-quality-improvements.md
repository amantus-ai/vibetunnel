# Code Quality Improvements Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented all requested code quality improvements for the Playwright test utilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Timestamp Bug in Session Cleanup
**File**: `src/test/playwright/helpers/session-cleanup.helper.ts`
- Added validation for missing timestamps
- Added NaN check for invalid dates
- Treats sessions with invalid/missing timestamps as old and marks them for cleanup

### 2. Enhanced Logger with Proper Abstraction
**File**: `src/test/playwright/utils/logger.ts`
- Implemented structured logging with log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Added colorization for better readability
- Added ISO8601 timestamps
- Created scoped loggers for different components
- Proper error serialization and data formatting

### 3. Added Exponential Backoff for Polling
**File**: `src/test/playwright/helpers/batch-operations.helper.ts`
- Implemented exponential backoff in `waitForSessionsState` method
- Starting delay: 50ms, max delay: 500ms, backoff factor: 1.5
- Reduces server load during polling operations

### 4. Added Input Validation for Security
**File**: `src/test/playwright/utils/validation.utils.ts` (new)
- Created validation functions for session names and commands
- Validates against dangerous patterns (command injection, directory traversal)
- Length limits and character restrictions
- Added HTML sanitization and URL validation utilities

**Updated Files**:
- `src/test/playwright/pages/session-list.page.ts` - Added validation calls

### 5. Fixed Promise.race Null Handling
**File**: `src/test/playwright/utils/optimized-wait.utils.ts`
- Changed catch handlers to return `null` instead of `undefined`
- Added explicit error throwing when all promises fail
- Prevents silent failures in app initialization detection

### 6. Centralized Magic String Constants
**File**: `src/test/playwright/constants/session.constants.ts` (new)
- Created centralized constants for session states, selectors, defaults, and endpoints
- Provides type safety with TypeScript const assertions
- Reduces maintenance burden and prevents typos

**Updated Files**:
- `src/test/playwright/helpers/batch-operations.helper.ts` - Uses SESSION_STATE constants
- `src/test/playwright/helpers/session-cleanup.helper.ts` - Uses logger instead of console

## Code Quality Status
✅ All linting errors fixed
✅ All TypeScript compilation successful
✅ Code formatting verified
✅ All requested improvements implemented

## Testing Recommendations
1. Run full Playwright test suite to verify no regressions
2. Monitor test execution times to verify exponential backoff improvements
3. Test validation functions with various malicious inputs
4. Verify logger output formatting in CI environment
