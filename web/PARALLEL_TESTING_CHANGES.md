# Parallel Testing Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `parallel-playwright` branch
- New branch created from main for all parallel testing improvements

### 2. Separated Global Tests
- Created `session-management-global.spec.ts` for tests that affect all sessions
- Moved "Kill All" and "Filter Sessions" tests from `session-management-advanced.spec.ts`
- These tests must run serially to avoid interfering with other tests

### 3. Added Parallel Configuration
Added `test.describe.configure({ mode: 'parallel' });` to these test files:
- `session-creation.spec.ts`
- `basic-session.spec.ts` 
- `minimal-session.spec.ts`
- `debug-session.spec.ts`
- `ui-features.spec.ts`
- `test-session-persistence.spec.ts`
- `session-navigation.spec.ts`
- `session-management.spec.ts`
- `session-management-advanced.spec.ts`

### 4. Updated playwright.config.ts
- Changed `fullyParallel: true` (was false)
- Changed `workers: process.env.CI ? 2 : undefined` (was 1)
- Created two project configurations:
  - `chromium-parallel` - for tests that can run concurrently
  - `chromium-serial` - for tests that must run sequentially

### 5. Created Helper Script
- `scripts/test-parallel.sh` - Easy way to run different test configurations
- Options: all, parallel, serial, debug, ui

### 6. Documentation
- `src/test/playwright/PARALLEL_TESTING.md` - Comprehensive guide
- Explains test organization, best practices, and troubleshooting

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Tests can now run concurrently, significantly reducing total execution time
2. **Isolation**: Better test organization ensures tests don't interfere with each other
3. **Flexibility**: Can run parallel or serial tests separately as needed
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add more workers or implement sharding in the future

## Test Organization

**Parallel Tests (31 tests)**
- Session creation and management (individual operations)
- UI features and navigation
- Session persistence
- Isolated session operations

**Serial Tests (21 tests)**
- Global operations (Kill All)
- Session filtering with global state changes
- Keyboard shortcuts (some may affect global state)
- Terminal interaction (currently skipped)

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
./scripts/test-parallel.sh all

# Run only parallel tests
./scripts/test-parallel.sh parallel

# Run only serial tests  
./scripts/test-parallel.sh serial
```

## Next Steps

1. Monitor test stability with parallel execution
2. Adjust worker count based on performance
3. Consider adding test sharding for even more parallelization
4. Add performance metrics to track improvements
