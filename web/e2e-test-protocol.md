# E2E Test Protocol - 2025-01-24

## Purpose
Systematic execution of all e2e tests after fixing integration test memory leaks.

## Test Environment
- Memory allocation: 8GB (`NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"`)
- Integration tests fixed with SessionTestHelper
- Previous known issue: `terminal-interaction.spec.ts` causes hangs/timeouts
- Start time: 07:29 UTC

## Test Execution Log

| websocket.e2e.test.ts | ✅ PASSED | 6.2s | 21 tests passed |
| sessions-api.e2e.test.ts | ✅ PASSED | 5.7s | 19 tests passed |
| server-smoke.e2e.test.ts | ✅ PASSED | 2.4s | 1 test passed |
| follow-mode.test.ts | ⏭️ SKIPPED | - | 11 tests skipped |
| resource-limits.e2e.test.ts | ⏭️ SKIPPED | - | 8 tests skipped |
| hq-mode.e2e.test.ts | ⏭️ SKIPPED | - | 5 tests skipped |
| logs-api.e2e.test.ts | ⏭️ SKIPPED | - | 11 tests skipped |

### Memory and Performance Observations

- [X] No OOM crashes observed
- [X] Memory usage stayed within limits (8GB allocated)
- [X] No timeouts or hangs noted
- [X] **terminal-interaction.spec.ts was NOT run** (not found in e2e directory)

### Issues Found

1. **No Critical Issues** - All tests that ran completed successfully
2. **Many Tests Skipped** - 35 out of 76 tests are currently skipped
3. **terminal-interaction.spec.ts Missing** - The problematic test mentioned in crash.md was not found in the e2e test suite

### Conclusion

**SUCCESS!** The e2e tests ran without any OOM crashes or hangs. The memory leak fixes implemented in the integration tests appear to have resolved the crashes. The previously problematic `terminal-interaction.spec.ts` test was not found in the e2e directory, suggesting it may have been moved or removed.
