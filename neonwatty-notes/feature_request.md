## Problem

There’s some natural limitations of a one-to-one terminal view on mobile like visual clutter (long lines from output and thinking, ANSI junk, etc.,), and I find myself using the same slash / probing commands repeatedly (e.g., /compact, /clear, 'what's next?', etc.,).

## Proposal: Add a Mobile Chat View

An additional "Chat View" (ala the style of iMessage / WhatsApp, etc.,) of a terminal window could help reduce the visual / data entry complexity on mobile. I’m imagining the typical “chat bubble” interface.

Switching it on could remove / fold certain verbose Claude Code messaging (e.g., “thinking” steps), and make conversating with Claude Code more natural and less cluttered on mobile. The ability to "quick reply" with a button click for sending slash commands / common requests could make mobile usage easier too.
