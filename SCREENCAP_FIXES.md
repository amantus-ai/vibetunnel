# Screen Capture Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

Based on the analysis of the screen capture implementation, the following issues were identified and fixed:

### 1. Incorrect Scaling of SCDisplay Dimensions
**Issue**: The code was incorrectly multiplying SCDisplay.width/height by scaleFactor, but SCDisplay dimensions are already in pixels, not points.
**Fix**: Removed all scaleFactor multiplication for SCDisplay dimensions.

### 2. Wrong sourceRect for Single Display Capture
**Issue**: For single display capture, sourceRect was set to (0,0,w,h) which doesn't work correctly for secondary monitors.
**Fix**: Changed to use `display.frame` which includes the proper origin coordinates.

### 3. Incorrect scalesToFit Setting
**Issue**: scalesToFit was set to true for all displays mode, which could cause unwanted scaling.
**Fix**: Set `scalesToFit = false` for all capture modes to ensure native resolution capture.

### 4. CIContext Performance Issue
**Issue**: A new CIContext was being created for every frame, which is expensive.
**Fix**: Created a reusable CIContext instance with optimized settings.

### 5. Window Capture Over-scaling
**Issue**: Window capture was also incorrectly multiplying by scaleFactor.
**Fix**: Removed scaleFactor multiplication for window dimensions.

## Changes Made

1. **ScreencapService.swift**:
   - Added reusable CIContext instance property
   - Fixed all displays capture to use correct dimensions without scaling
   - Fixed single display capture to use display.frame for sourceRect
   - Fixed window capture to use dimensions without scaling
   - Set scalesToFit = false for all capture modes
   - Updated getCurrentFrame to use reusable CIContext

2. **Web Code**:
   - Ran lint:fix to clean up any formatting issues
   - All TypeScript checks pass

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test single display capture on both primary and secondary monitors
2. Test all displays capture mode with multiple monitors
3. Test window capture with windows on different monitors
4. Verify that captured resolution matches native display resolution
5. Check performance improvements from CIContext reuse

The fixes should resolve the scaling issues and improve capture quality and performance.
