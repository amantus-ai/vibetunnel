# Screen Share Investigation - SCShareableContent Returns No Displays

## Summary

I investigated the issue where the screen sharing feature in VibeTunnel fails with "No display available" error. The root cause is that `SCShareableContent.excludingDesktopWindows()` returns 0 displays even though:

1. Screen Recording permission is granted
2. NSScreen.screens correctly shows 3 displays
3. The same API returns 664 windows

## Findings

### Test Results
```
ðŸ“º NSScreen.screens: 3 displays found
  - DELL U4025QW (3840x1620)
  - Built-in Retina Display (1800x1169)  
  - PG42UQ (3008x1692)

ðŸ“º SCShareableContent: 0 displays, 664 windows
```

### Debugging Added
1. Enhanced logging in `getDisplays()` to show NSScreen vs SCShareableContent results
2. Added `testShareableContent()` diagnostic method that tries various API calls
3. Implemented NSScreen fallback when SCShareableContent fails

### Workaround Implemented
When `SCShareableContent` returns no displays, the code now falls back to using `NSScreen` data to populate the display list. This allows the UI to show available displays, though actual screen capture won't work since `SCShareableContent` is required for that functionality.

### Root Cause
This appears to be a system-level issue with ScreenCaptureKit on this particular macOS installation. Possible causes:
- A bug in macOS or ScreenCaptureKit
- System configuration issue
- Interference from other screen recording software

### Next Steps
1. The fallback allows display enumeration to work
2. Actual screen capture will still fail since `SCShareableContent` is required
3. May need to file a radar with Apple or investigate system-specific issues
4. Consider implementing full NSScreen-based capture as an alternative (more complex)

## Code Changes
- Modified `ScreencapService.swift` to add NSScreen fallback in `getDisplays()`
- Added diagnostic logging throughout the display detection flow
- Created test scripts to isolate the issue (now removed)
